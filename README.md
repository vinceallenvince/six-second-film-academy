#Six-Second Film Academy

The Six-Second Film Academy is a collaborative exercise on short-form storytelling. You’ll work with a team for ~1 hour and create a six second film based on a prompt.

While the format is different from a conventional motion picture, the process is similar. You should conceive, plan and execute just as if you were on the crew of a major motion picture. The obvious difference, you have a fraction of the time and… yeah, your film is a [Vine](http://vine.co).

###Your deliverables 
At the end of an hour, you must upload your film to Vine and share the url at the bottom of this document.

###Your subject matter
You’ll receive a prompt like, “blah, blah, blah” or “blah, blah, blah”. Your interpretation is entirely up to you. However, your film should in some way relate to your prompt.

###Constraints
Your film must be ~six seconds in duration and shareable on Vine. (Vines are actually [6.5 seconds long](https://vine.co/v/ijpzbKzzrlP).)

###Requirements
The cinematographer should have either an iPhone or Android phone and a Vine account.

###Roles
All film crews have roles. It’s up to you to decide who occupies these roles. One person may take on more than one role. Also, at any point, roles may switch. However, before beginning, you should decide as a team who will initially take on the following:

* Scriptwriter/Storyboard editor
Writes the story for the screen.

* Cinematographer
Makes decisions on composition and framing of shots. Holds a Vine account.

* Film editor
Assembles various shots into a coherent film.

###Tools
Vine is incredibly easy to use. But you do not have to use the Vine app to shoot your film. There are a number of tools you can use to shoot, edit and add effects. 


###Here’s a list of popular video tools useful for Vine videos.
